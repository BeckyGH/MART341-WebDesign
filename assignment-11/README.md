## What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font?
System fonts are ones that are already on your computer or device, they are available to the user and the programs used on the device but not necessarily good for the web. Web fonts are customized fonts that are optimized to use on the web. They can be called up using certain elements with css and as long as the browser can support the css then the font will be displayed as you have chosen. On the other hand web-safe fonts are ones that are guaranteed to be available across all common systems. 

## What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?
 It's good practice to include your preferred font, then a web-safe alternative or system font, or both, just in case a webfont is unable to be rendered due to system compatibility issues or lengthy download times. Also, making sure they are aesthetically compatible or similar to prevent user disruption or cause the layout of the page to be affected. 

## Free Response: Please discuss any challenges you had this week and what you did to overcome them.
This week went fairly well, a lot easier than last week. I did reference back to the textbook, took your advice, and also read a few articles about the "how to's" of getting my design ideas into a html layout. Just have to remember to be patient with myself:)
