        <p><span style="font-variant: small-caps; color: green;">They crossed the desert for another two days in silence. </span>The alchemist had become much more cautious because 
            they were approaching the area where the most violent battles were being waged. As they moved along, the boy tried 
            to listen to his heart.
        </p>
    </div>

        <p>
            It was not easy to do, in earlier times, his heart had always been ready to tell its story, but lately, that wasn’t true.
            There had been times when his heart spent hours telling of its sadness, and at other times it became so emotional over 
            the desert sunrise that the boy had to hide his tears. His heart beat fastest when it spoke to the boy of treasure, and more 
            slowly when the boy stared entranced at the endless horizons of the desert. But his heart was never quiet, even when the boy 
            and the alchemist had fallen into silence.
        </p>
  
        <p>
            “Why do we have to listen to our hearts?” the boy asked when they had made camp that day. “Because, wherever your heart is, 
            that is where you’ll find your treasure.”
        </p>

        <p>
            “But my heart is agitated,” the boy said. “ It has its dreams, it gets emotional, and it’s become passionate over a woman of the desert. 
            It asks things of me, and it keeps me from sleeping many nights, when I’m thinking about her.”
          
        </p>
  
        <p>
            “Well, that’s good. Your heart is alive. Keep listening to what it has to say.”
        </p>
 
        <p>
            During the next three days, the two travelers passed by a number of armed tribesman, and saw others on the horizon. 
            The boy’s heart began to speak of fear. It told him stories it had heard from the Souls of the World, stories of men who sought to find 
            their treasure and never succeeded. Sometimes it frightened the boy with the idea that he might not find his treasure, or that he 
            might die there in the desert. At other times, it told the boy that it was satisfied: it had found love and riches. 

        </p>
 
        <p>
            “My heart is a traitor,” the boy said to the alchemist, when they had paused to rest the horses. “It doesn’t want me to go on.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “That makes sense,” the alchemist answered. “Naturally it’s afraid that, in pursuing your dream, you might lose everything you’ve won.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Well, then, why should I listen to my heart?”
        </p>

        <p>
            “Because you will never again be able to keep it quiet. Even if you pretend not to have heard what it tells you, it will always be there inside you, 
            repeating to you what you’re thinking about life and about the world.”
          
        </p>
