1.)Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do they serve?

The type of form I use most while on the web is the login form, which it's pretty obvious it's purpose which is to give users access to thier accounts. 
I'd say the next most popular type would be an order form, which myself and millions of other people use to place online orders. Survey forms do pop up frequently, however, I don't fill them out regularly but they are useful to obtain data about services, products, demographics, and peoples opinions, etc. 


2.)List examples of text, selection, and button input, and their usage.

Text Types examples:
input type="text"--A plain text box is created for users to type in info. 
input type="password"--This creates an text entry field where the characters are hidden by asteriks (*). 
input type="textarea"--This allows users to enter long responses. 

Selection Type examples:
input type="radio"--This creates a radio button where you can only select one item at a time.
input type="checkbox"--This creates a way for users to select or deselect one or multiple options at a time. 

Button Type examples:
input type="file"--Allows users to open a navigation window and select a file to be uploaded.
input type="submit"--This button sends a form to a server. 
input type="image"--Creates an image to use as the submit button. 



3.)Free Response: Please discuss your successes and challenges.  How did you overcome your challenges?

I think my biggest challenges this week was the styling of assignment 7, I again researched on the web about how to do different things. I feel eager to make the page more interactive and be able to implement more elements of design to make it look cleaner and more professional. I know that will come with time and knowledge. 
 I feel successful in getting through all the material for the week and feeling like I have a clear understanding of it all, so far. I really enjoying coding, I like how it appeals to my analytical tendencies and at the same time satisfies my creative desire.
