                        My whole life I have always enjoyed art of any kind. As a kid I would spend hours drawing, painting, and daydreaming about becoming an artist.
                        My passion is to create, inspire, and live life to the fulliest. I work out of a room in my home with my cat Sphinx, and lots of plants.

                        I was born and raised in Kansas, yes I know "I'm not in Kansas anymore". My parents raised me strong willed, hardworking, and to take no shit.  
                        I grew up with very little material things which I believe attributes to my very active imagination. Taking nothing and making something requires
                        you to be very creative. 
                        
                </p>
                <p>
                        I attended college in my early 20's and study the Fine Arts. I soon grew bored with Kansas and needed a change of scenery, 
                        thus began the rest of my life. I took a semester off college, sold everything in my apartment and heading out on the road. 
                        I backpacked for months, camping, hiking and finding myself. I soon landed in Montana and instantly fell in love, with the mountains and waters, of course. 
                        This is where the real adventure began and I started my family. Now my daughter and I live 
                        in one of the most beautiful places on Earth and I am continuing my education in the arts. 
                </p>
                <p>
                        In spring of 2024 I plan to graduate with a Bachelor's in Media Arts and thus begin another new career adventure in this wonderful thing called life. 
                        I would love for you to connect with me and reach out if you think I am the right fit for your creative needs.
