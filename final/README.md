## Did you learn anything new about web development (i.e., using GitHub, version control, repositories)?
I learned quite a bit this semestser, I am definetly more familiar with GitHub and overall web development because of this class. 
Everything was fairly new to me this semester once we starting digging deeper, however, I did have a basic knowledge from taking your Creative Coding course. Learning CSS was probably the most rewarding, I realize now how much time and effort 
it takes to accomplish responsive, user friendly webpages.

## Did you learn anything new about web design (i.e., using media, color, fonts)?
I really enjoy the designing aspect and I could see myself easily going the route of web designer and developer in my career choice. 
I know I have lots more to learn but it's something I absolutely enjoyed doing. 
Working with media was definetly new for me, I feel like I need to keep exploring it. 
This semester and especially when working on the final I realized just how much of my own media I do not have...although I did get busy in photoshop and create photos to add to the webpages. In the future I'm going to work on acquiring more videos, photos, etc so I am able to create my personal/professional portfolio, in hopes to eventually have my own website up and running. Overall the designing was my favorite part, I loved learning how to accomplish awesome looking web pages with layout(although difficult for me at first), positioning, color schemes and interactivity.

## Free Response: Discuss any challenges you had and what you did to overcome them.
One of the challenges of the final was trying to decide on how I wanted to present myself and coming up with a color scheme. I reached way out of my comfort zone and went bold. I wanted to capture the essence of the fun side of my personality and showcase myself in a energetic way. I was looking for
a balance of catching attention, yet enough subtlety and personal touch to represent me.
