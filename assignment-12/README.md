## What is the difference between padding, margin, and borders?
Padding refers to the space betwween the inner content of an element and the border. The border is a box that goes around the content of an element. It can be styled and sized by using border properties. The margin refers to the space  between the element and other elements or the edge of the parent element. 


## Free Response: Discuss any challenges you had this week and how you overcame them.
This week I wanted to challenge myself to create a webpage that could potentially represent a "mock-up" tour guide company. I struggled with
the color this week. Trying to find ones that represent the "company" or my vision of a fun, easy-going company. While working on the layout I learned alot and again did quite a bit of trial and error. This may be a bit silly but I would put a border around the element/content to help guide me. Made it a bit easier to see where things were and how they were grouped and therefore I could position things a bit easier, not sure it's the best strategy but it worked for me now :)
