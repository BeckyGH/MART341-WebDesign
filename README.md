Repo for my Web Design course homework.

Summary of Week 2

I learned about files and some of the most common types used in website building/design. Also reviewed over best practices for structuring and naming directories
when building a website. I think getting familiar with navigating and using the GitHub platform in depth was the challenge of this week. I'm not sure I still fully wrap my head around how all of it works, but it's becoming easier and more clear. The biggest success would be I have a better understanding of how and why 
to structure my directories and files on my desktop when building websites.
