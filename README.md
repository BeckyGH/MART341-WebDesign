Repo for my Web Design course homework.

Summary of Week 2

I learned about files and some of the most common types used in website building/design. Also reviewed over best practices for structuring and naming directories
when building a website. I think getting use to navigating and using the GitHub platform in more depth was the biggest challenge this week. I'm not sure I still fully wrap my head around how all of it works, but it's becoming a familiarity.
