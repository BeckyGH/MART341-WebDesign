<p>
Where the Wild Things Are is a world famous classic childrens book that is one of my favorites of all time. An imaginative 
story told about unconditional parental love. The story is about a young boy named Max that causes havoc with his parents and is sent to his room with no dinner.
In his room alone Max begins on a wild journey of his imagination, filled with adventure and lively beasts. 
On this journey Max arrives at his destination of where the wild things are, encountering scary beasts like creatures and unknown 
territory. He soon finds the courage to stand up to the beasts and is crowned king of the wild things. He playfully romps
 with the beasts through the jungle to finally send them to sleep with no dinner. Max eventually leaves the wild thing island to return
back to his bedroom where he finds his dinner waiting for him, still hot.

    in 1964 and quickly became known worldwide.
