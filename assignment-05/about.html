become an illustrator. He went on to have some of his first works published in 1947 in a textbook. Eventually his illustrations 
would lead him to writing his own books.</p>

    internationally famous. Maurice continued to write and illustrate childrens books throughout his entire life. He also 
    worked on production and design in television and even adapted Where the Wild Things Are to a playwrite.
