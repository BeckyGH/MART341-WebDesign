## Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?
The universal selector uses an asterik and it can be used when you want the properties and values, rules, to apply to the entire html document.  
When using the element selector you use the elements name and the declarations you choose will be applied to that element  
type throughout the document. Element selectors ase a good choice when you want to style a particular element the same way throughout the html.   
The class selector allows you assign class names to different elements using the class="" attribute and you have use a dot before the name in your   
css page. This is useful and an easy way to create a style rule that can be applied to different elements and you can have multiple classes on a   
single class attribute separated by a space. The ID selector is alot like the class in that you can use the id="" attribute for different elements    
However, the name has to be unique and it is used to select and style a specific element.  


## Briefly discuss your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, RGB values, or hex codes.
For this assignment I did a little research into some color scheme using Adobe Color and Coolors.co to come up with  
one I thought represented the "mood" of the 60's & 70's decades. I chose mostly muted hues to compliment the images that have a moderate intensity to them.   


The colors I used for the images in the page are as follows:  
1. Beatles Image: It relates closest to color name Portland Orange; rgb(255, 90, 31); hex #ff5a1f.  
2. Lava lamp Image: It relaes closest to color name Turquoise Blue; rgb(110, 214, 255); hex #6ed6ff.  
3. Fashion Image: Again it relates closest to the name Sunglow; rgb(255, 203, 46); hex #ffcb2e.  
4. Header background: Closest to Horizon; rgb(82, 144, 163, .8).   

## Free Response: Please discuss any challenges you had this week and how you overcame them.
I struggled quite a bit with this asignment, in fact I have been working honestly ALL weekend (hrs upon hrs) trying to figure out "how to" pull off the design I wanted.  
I did accomplish the style of how I wanted the page to look however, I could not figure out how to get it to be responsive, as in the text paragraphs to scale  
in and out with the browser which was bothering me quite alot. It was like I had a design with images/backgrounds and paragraphs on top, the "design" would scale with the browser   
but not the text of the paragraphs within the "design". ( not sure if that makes sense) This bothered me so much that I changed my design and learned how to make the webpage respond correctly to different  
browser widths. Anyhow, this week I could of probably used a one on one zoom with you but it took me till Thursday to get through all the material and   
I didn't anticipate this much trouble. I wasn't able to meet the position criteria of using absolute either, when i applied it to the elements or the classes it just looked funny   
because of how I set up the rest of the content...I did learn ALOT through all my trial and errors though, WOWZA!
