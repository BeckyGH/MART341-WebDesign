## Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?
The universal selector uses an asterik and it can be used when you want the properties and values, rules, to apply to the entire html document. 
When using the element selector you use the elements name and the declarations you choose will be applied to that element 
type throughout the document. Element selectors ase a good choice when you want to style a particular element the same way throughout the html. 
The class selector allows you assign class names to different elements using the class="" attribute and you have use a dot before the name in your 
css page. This is useful and an easy way to create a style rule that can be applied to different elements and you can have multiple classes on a 
single class attribute separated by a space. The ID selector is alot like the class in that you can use the id="" attribute for different elements 
However, the name has to be unique and it is used to select and style a specific element.  


## Briefly discuss your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, RGB values, or hex codes.
For this assignment I did a little research into some color scheme using Adobe Color and Coolors.co to come up with 
one I thought represented the "mood" of the 60's & 70's decades. I chose mostly muted hues to compliment the images that have a moderate intensity to them.  


The colors I used for the images in the page are as follows:  
1. Beatles Image: It relates closest to color name Portland Orange; rgb(255, 90, 31); hex #ff5a1f.  
2. Lava lamp Image: It relaes closest to color name Turquoise Blue; rgb(110, 214, 255); hex #6ed6ff.  
3. Fashion Image: Again it relates closest to the name Sunglow; rgb(255, 203, 46); hex #ffcb2e.  
4. Header background: Closest to Horizon; rgb(82, 144, 163, .8).   

## Free Response: Please discuss any challenges you had this week and how you overcame them.
I struggled quite a bit with this asignment, in fact I have been working honestly ALL weekend (hrs upon hrs) trying to figure out "how to" pull off the design I wanted. 
I did accomplish the style of how I wanted the page to look however, I could not figure out how to get it to be responsive, the text paragraphs wouldn't scale 
within the design, which was bothering me quite alot. So, I changed my entire design and learned how to make the webpage respond correctly to different 
browser widths.  I wasn't able to meet the position criteria of using absolute either, when i applied it to the elements or the classes it just looked funny 
because of how I set up the rest of the content. Anyhow, this week there were alot of learning curves for me, I did learn ALOT through all my trial and errors though, WOWZA!
