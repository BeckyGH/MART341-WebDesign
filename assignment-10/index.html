                                     In the 60's &amp; 70's music was very much in a revolution and all sorts of norms were being broken. 
                                    The genres of folk music, pop music, and "Rock N Roll" found their way into the mainstream media. The Beatles soon found their
                                     way to America in 1964 and stepped into the radical counterculture to bring the fans something revolutionary and thrilling.

                                There was an abundance of cultural experimentation in the 60's &amp; 70's, fashion being on at the forefront. Men and women were experimenting with 
                                very unique design trends.  Generally young people were the ones who 
                                embraced the new styles, wearing bell bottom jeans, tie-dye, and batik fabrics infused with paisley prints. Hairstyles went from conservative to a more natural look. The decades created a 
                                new sense of freedom in what was fashionably acceptable.
