1. The internet is a global network of computers that are all interconnected and includes serivces such as the world wide web. 
The World wide web is an information service that runs on the internet, where web pages(information) can connect through hyperlinks and url's. 

2.The internet is a wire that connects computers together in order to share information. It has directly connected computers, servers, 
that are communicating with each other. It uses IP, (Internet Protocol), that gives each device
it's own unique address, and whether the device is connected directly or indirectly to the internet, the IP makes the devices
accessible for communication and helps direct the traffic of information. Most home/personal
devices(clients) need to use an ISP(Internet Service Provider) to get connected to the internet.

3.A directory is a place where you can organize and store your files on your computer. It's the "container" where files are stored. 

4. I think VCS will take some of the pressure off of making mistakes. I like the idea of being able to go back and access
previous versions and that it allows for easy testing of ideas.
