## 1.) Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?
I really enjoyed learning further in depth html, learning more elements and their attributes. Especially the 
media elements, those really make a webpage interesting and give a personalized feel to it. Although it has been 
challenging to remember which attributes are required and recommended with which elements, I know
that will become easier with more experience using them. 


## 2.) Next module we continue with CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?
I'd have to say I'm excited to get into CSS and learn how to style pages more in depth. That's honestly 
been my biggest challenge with my assignment so far, the desire to "do more" design and not knowing how to.  


## 3.) Free Response: Summarize your challenges and successes.  What did you do to overcome your challenges?
This week for some reason was diffucult, I struggled with getting all the required "parts" of the assignment
into the pages. I think overall I was sucessfull but feel like I could of set things up differently(?) within
my coding.
