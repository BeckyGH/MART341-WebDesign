# 1.)Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans.
The div tag is used to create a block level container to put other elements, it can be used to create \
structure and easy styling to the entire page. The class attribute can be used with the div tag and other \ 
tags to style that section or area of the html page. Using an id attribute specifies a unique id for an html element.\
You can't have more than one element with the same id because that id is related to a specific style from a style sheet.\
A span element is used inline with content to identify or group together content that may need organizing or different\
styling than the rest of the block. It usally is applied when you want text to appear unique.


# 2.)Talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using a service like YouTube or Vimeo to host your videos?
It seems one of the biggest advantages of third party hosting is that it can handle large, high quality versions for the\
files your using at an affordable rate. They can also take care of the compatibility and coding automatically for your \
media to play on a variety of browsers. When using third party services you have to be a stickler about making sure your\
media abides by copyright criteria/laws which can be a hassle but is also a good thing because you too have that protection\
of your content if you use their services. However if your needing an upgrade of storage or services it can get pretty pricey. 


# 3.)Free Response: What challenges did you have this week? How did you overcome them?
I'd say my biggest challenge this week was kind of silly but it was picking just 'one' favorite song, there's just too many!\
As far as technical issues I didn't seem to run across to many, I do know I will probalby neeed to work on remembering all the\ required attributes and additional attributes that go with the elements. I've been taking screenshots and notes to easily\ reference back.
