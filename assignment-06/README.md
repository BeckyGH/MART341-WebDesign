1.)How many main document <head> and <body> elements can a page have? How are these elements different, or what role do they play?

I think the answer is one head and body per page. The head is like the behind the scenes container. It stores the high level information about the site and is not visible to the viewers of the page. It includes the processing and metadata information. The body is where you input the data that will instruct the browsers about how the display of the document will look, this is what the viewer sees.  


2.)Describe the difference between structural and semantic markup.

Structural markup is the information that provides the page layout of the document such as the headings, paragraphs, breaks, and lists. The semantic markup is the indicators of the content. It can be used to add extra or reinforce meaning to what is being displayed.    


3.)Free Response: Summarize your challenges and successes this week.  How did you overcome your challenges?

This week while working on my recipe document I struggled some with wanting to "do more", but of course having only limited knowledge, as of now. I looked up quite a bit of info on 'how to' and used what I remembered from my last class. I think I was pretty successful at making it look visually balanced and pleasing. The Visual Code editor is so helpful in it's suggestions, it would take me a very long time if I didn't have this resource.
