## Who was your imaginary client? How did they describe their site needs?
For this assignment I just re worked the last page I coded when working on positioning. I made up a fake tour
guide service for Yellowstone National Park. Wanted a site that would be light, fun, yet informative. I think I'm lacking a bit on the styling this assignment but I focused on layout the most and playing around with the columns and learning to use the mobile design method most. 

## Why is it important to consider a mobile-first design?
It's super important because most people are using thier phones to access the web and get information. If a site is not optimized for mobile use and customers are unable to obtain and access what they want or need quickly and efficiently sites can potentially lose those customers.

## Free Response: Please discuss your challenges and how you overcame them.
I'd have to say this week I'm just glad I'm here and starting to slowly feel better. I'm grateful I get a chance to continue learning and working on my assignments and grateful for your support and understanding through this rough week.
